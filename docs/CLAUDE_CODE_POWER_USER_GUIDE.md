## 🤖 Subagents - Specialized AI Assistants

### What Are Subagents?

Subagents are **specialized AI assistants** that operate in separate context windows, each with focused expertise, custom system prompts, and specific tool access. Think of them as having a team of specialists rather than one generalist.

> **⚠️ Important**: Project-specific agents created in `.claude/agents/` are invoked using Claude's Task tool with the `subagent_type` parameter, not through the `/agents` command. The `/agents` command is for Claude's built-in agents.

### Key Benefits

- **🎯 Focused Expertise**: Each agent specializes in specific domains
- **💾 Context Preservation**: Main conversation stays clean and focused
- **♻️ Reusable Across Projects**: User-level agents work everywhere
- **🛡️ Controlled Tool Access**: Agents only get tools they need
